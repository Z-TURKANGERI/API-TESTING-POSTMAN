# API-TESTING-POSTMAN
This repository contains a list of dummy projects with API testing as per my best knowledge. 

# Getting started 
Restful-booker API Testing is focused on testing the functionalities of the "Restful-booker." The goal of this project is to ensure that all 
API endpoints work as expected and provide accurate responses. The API is designed to manage user accounts, retrieve user data, and handle 
various CRUD operations.

# Running the Postman Collection:
Follow these steps to run the API tests using Postman:

Launch Postman on your computer.
Click on the "Import" button and select the "Restful-booker.postman_collection" JSON file needs to you downloaded from here or use links to import.
Once the collection is imported, you will see it in the left sidebar under "Collections."
Click on the collection to expand it and reveal the individual requests and tests.
Adjust the environment variables if necessary (e.g., API base URL, authentication tokens, etc.).
To execute the entire collection, click on the "Run" button at the top-right corner of the collection window.
Review the test results to ensure that all tests have passed.
# Excel Test Cases:
The Excel file "Restful-booker.xlsx" contains a detailed list of test cases for Project1 API testing. Each test case includes the API endpoint, request data, expected response, and the validation criteria. You can find the Excel file in this project folder.
